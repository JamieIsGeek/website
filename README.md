### This website was mainly created for me to trial out using HTML, CSS & JS!
<br />

## This was coded in:

[<img align="left" alt="CSS" width="26px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/80688e429a7d4ef2fca1e82350fe8e3517d3494d/topics/css/css.png" />] (https://www.google.com)

This website mainly uses HTML and has support for both Mobile and PC Users. 

Feel free to modify / host this yourself, its fairly self explanitory to use and modify  and can be hosted locally, on [ReplIT](https://www.replt.it/), or anything that can run HTML, CSS & JS!
